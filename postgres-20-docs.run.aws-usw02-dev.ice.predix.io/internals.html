# Service Internals

These details are provided as a courtesy for the curious.  They are not public
interfaces, and are subject to change without notice.

## Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry provides a simple set of primitives for operation.  This service
uses only these primitives in public APIs.

## Amazon RDS Postgres

The database instances provided by the service are actually Amazon RDS Postgres
instances. The service sends a subset of RDS API calls.

### High Availability
Every DB instance is configured for High Availability by choosing AWS’ Multi-AZ
(a.k.a multi-datacenter) configuration. Every DB instance has a synchronous
replica in a close-by Availability Zone (AZ). This replica is not available or
even visible to customers (even to Postgres-2.0 service). In case of a failure
of the primary DB instance or the AZ in which that DB instance is running
Amazon RDS promotes the synchronous replica and makes that available to the
applications for use. There is no SLA on how long this failover can take, hence
no guarantees on how long the downtime would be in case of a failure. The DB
instance's URL does not change after a failover, hence a reconfiguration of
applications is not necessary; the applications have to just keep retrying to
reconnect to the database.

### Encryption at Rest
For a DB instance that requires encryption-at-rest, Postgres-2.0 service creates
a Customer Master Key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Postgres-2.0
service sends the CMK’s id is sent to Amazon RDS as part of DB instance creation
request. Amazon RDS uses the CMK to create the Amazon EBS volumes. Every
encrypted DB instance that requested encryption uses a dedicated CMK; in other
words, the CMKs are not shared between DB instances, with an exception. The DB
instances that are created using Point-in-Time Recovery feature (see
Postgres-2.0 docs) with an encrypted DB instance as a source, share the CMK.

### Max Connections Per Plan
|  Plan Name      |                    Description                     | Max Connections |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|  dedicated-1.1  |   Dedicated Postgres DB Instance: 1 CPU 1 GB RAM   |         87      |
|  dedicated-5.1  |   Dedicated Postgres DB Instance: 1 CPU 2 GB RAM   |        198      |
|  dedicated-10.1 |   Dedicated Postgres DB Instance: 2 CPU 8 GB RAM   |        856      |
|  dedicated-20.1 |   Dedicated Postgres DB Instance: 4 CPU 16 GB RAM  |       1743      |
|  dedicated-30.1 |   Dedicated Postgres DB Instance: 8 CPU 32 GB RAM  |       3518      |
|  dedicated-40.1 |   Dedicated Postgres DB Instance: 16 CPU 64 GB RAM |       5000      |
