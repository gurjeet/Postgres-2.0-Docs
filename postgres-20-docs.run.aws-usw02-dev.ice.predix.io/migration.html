## Migrating from 'postgres' service to 'postgres-2.0' Service

### Assumptions

These steps must be executed with the following assumptions. Please be sure to
consider all these assumptions and their implications.

- The application uses exactly one database in `postgres` service.
- All the objects in the database are owned by exactly one user.
- That same user is the only entity that accesses the data from the application.
- The data is not being modified while the migration runs.
- The customer has created a new database instance of `postgres-2.0` serice in their Cloud Foundry Org.
- The superuser of the destination DB will own all the migrated objects.
- You have the credentials to connect to both the source and the destination database.
- Testing the migrated database is the customer's responsibility.

### Postgres-2.0 Instance Creation

Details about creating new instances and available plans can be found here.

### Launch a shell in Cloud Foundry

Launch a shell in same Cloud Foundry as hosting customer's Org.

Deploy the following application in your org and space :

1. Download and cf push

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/gurjeet/gotty-cf-bash
	cd gotty-cf-bash
	cf push --random-route
	```

2. Open the application's URL in a browser.

	Please prefix the app URL with `https://`. Google Chrome is known to work better with this application for copy-pasting text.

3. Set up the GoTTY application

	In the browser, open the URL from the Gotty app push, and execute the steps below on the terminal opened in the Gotty app on the browser. 

	```shell
	mkdir ${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install
	cd ${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install
	```

4. Downloading the needed libraries and client for Postgres

	```shell
	wget -q http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libe/libevent/libevent-2.0-5_2.0.21-stable-2_amd64.deb
	wget -q http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/t/tmux/tmux_1.8-5_amd64.deb

	ver=9.6 # Valid values: 10, 9.6
	module=postgresql-client-$ver
	q=-q
	case $ver in
		9.6)    pqOsVer=12 ;;
		10)     pqOsVer=14 ;;
		*)      die 2 "unsupported version $ver" ;;
	esac

	wget $q -nd -l1 -r --reject '*.git*' --accept "libpq5_${ver}*.pgdg*.*+1_amd64.deb" http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/pool/main/p/postgresql-$ver/
	wget $q -nd -l1 -r --reject '*.git*' --accept "${module}*.pgdg14.04+1_amd64.deb" http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/pool/main/p/postgresql-$ver/
	```

5. Extract from Archive

	```shell
	for f in *.deb; do rm -f data.tar.*;  ar x "$f";  tar xf data.tar.*;  done
	```

6. Set up environment variables for execution.

	```shell
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
	export PATH="${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install/usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/:${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install/usr/bin:${PATH}"
	```

7. Test installation

	`psql --help` should return the help menu for Postgres

	Customize the following snippet of shell code and perform the migration.

8. Launch tmux

    Launch `tmux` so that the console session is saved, even if you/browser get
	disconnected from the GoTTY server.

	```
	tmux
	```

9. Notes to Reconnect

    If you do get disconnected, simply refresh the browser window, and you would
	be reconnected to the GoTTY server, and should be greeted with the shell
	session of the container.

	To reconnect to the tmux session launched earlier, simply set the environmnet
	variables and reattach to the tmux session.

	```
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
	export PATH="${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install/usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/:${HOME}/tmp_postgres_install/usr/bin:${PATH}"

	tmux a
	```

8. Configure the Environment Variables

    Set the following environment variables related to the source and destination
	database instances.

	```shell
	SRC_DB_HOST=""
	SRC_DB_PORT=""
	SRC_DB_NAME=""
	SRC_USER_NAME=""
	SRC_USER_PASSWORD=""

	DEST_DB_HOST=""
	DEST_DB_PORT=""
	DEST_DB_NAME=""
	DEST_USER_NAME=""
	DEST_USER_PASSWORD=""
	```

### Perform Migration

Most of the extensions available in RDPG are available in RDS as well.
Specifically, the ones that are available by default in a freshly created RDPG
database are all available in RDS. This allows us to successfully execute
CREATE EXTENSION commands. But, since the customer's user is not a real
superuser in RDS instance, the 'COMMENT ON EXTENSION' commands fail. These
failures are benign, so we filter out these commands and prevent errors.

It would be preferrable to restore the database in a single transaction, by
using psql's --single-transaction. But we don't use that since that will make
the migration fail on first error. We would like to see all the errors in one go
so that all those errors can be addressed before next migration attempt. The
migrated database should be tested by the customer before the cutover, which
requires down time.

```shell
PGPASSWORD=$SRC_USER_PASSWORD pg_dump -h $SRC_DB_HOST -p $SRC_DB_PORT -U $SRC_USER_NAME -d $SRC_DB_NAME --serializable-deferrable --no-owner --no-privileges \
 | grep -v '^COMMENT ON EXTENSION' \
 | PGPASSWORD=$DEST_USER_PASSWORD psql -h $DEST_DB_HOST -p $DEST_DB_PORT -U $DEST_USER_NAME -d $DEST_DB_NAME --echo-all \
 > migration.log 2>&1
```
